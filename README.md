### Overview:

ResCast, our hackathon entry for the Wave2Web Hack, addresses the critical challenge of water management in Bengaluru, India. Rapid urbanization and swelling population, coupled with inefficient water management, have heightened the risk of drought and depleted water resources in the region. Recognizing the need for an advanced solution, our project proposes a predictive model to forecast reservoir water levels and storage volumes 1-3 months in advance, enabling better water risk management and decision-making.

### Problem Statement:

The increasing demand for water in Bengaluru, due to urbanization and population growth, has placed significant strain on local water resources. Key reservoirs like Krishnaraja Sagar and Kabini are crucial for the city’s water supply, but their levels have often fallen below minimum drawdown levels during peak summers. An accurate forecasting model is needed to manage these risks effectively.

### Solution - Hydrological Model:

Our solution, ResCast, uses hydrological modeling to predict reservoir metrics like water levels and storage volumes. The model incorporates time series data for hydro-meteorological variables to generate short-term predictions. This approach aids in assessing water availability for Bengaluru and its surrounding areas, contributing to more informed water management decisions.

### Key Features:

**Predictive Analytics**: Leveraging machine learning techniques to forecast reservoir levels and storage volumes.

**Data-Driven**: Utilizes a comprehensive dataset, including historical reservoir levels, meteorological data, and river flow metrics.

**Visualization and Contextual Elements**: Offers visual representations of forecasted data, aiding in easier interpretation and decision-making.

**Technologies Used**:

-   Python
-   R
-   Keras
-   Numpy
-   Pandas
-   Statsmodels
-   Matplotlib
-   Scikit Learn
-   Jupyter Notebook
